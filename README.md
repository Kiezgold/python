# Collection of Python scripts

``python3 skript_name.py``

codes.py:  Simple py script to create a list of possible combinations of four letters, where the last letter is always a "U".
copy_all_files.py: copies all files from a folder on the Desktop (named "Alt") and moves them to a new folder (named "Neu"). It searches through all subdirectories within the "Alt" folder and copies each file found into the "Neu" folder. If the "Neu" folder doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
